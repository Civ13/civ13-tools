# byond-hoster
This makes it possible for people to use BYOND to connect to civ13's TypeSpess though DreamDaemon.
The server will appear on the Hub too.

## setting up
Just set it up like a regular SS13 server: compile the dme into a dmb and launch.
Set your server address, and the other links, on `global.dm`.
